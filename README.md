# 💳 Loan Approval System

A Machine Learning–based **Loan Approval System** that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and employment status.

This project demonstrates the end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications every day. Manual evaluation is time-consuming and error-prone. 
Problem - Good customers sometimes get rejected and high risk customers sometimes get approved 
This system uses **machine learning algorithms** to automate the loan approval process and improve decision accuracy.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze loan applicant data
- Clean and preprocess missing & categorical values
- Train ML models to predict loan approval
- Evaluate model performance
- Predict loan approval for new applicants
